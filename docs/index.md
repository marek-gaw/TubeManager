# TubeManager

This application allows to manage links to (mainly) YT videos.

## Preface

The main reason to create this application is huge number of bookmarks gathered in [SkyTube](https://github.com/SkyTubeTeam/SkyTube). Despite of all goodies provided by this app, I cannot effectively manage bookmarks.

Since SkyTube allows to export bookmarks as a Sqlite file, it is quite easy to import those data and manage them.
