# Spikes

## db-scaffold

Spike to explore how to scaffold and map existing database with Entity Framework.

Results: SQLite database `bookmarks.sb` succesfully scaffolded by Entity Framework. Model created manually, because of data format (all relevant data are stored in a single cloumn with JSON content).
